Distributed Contexting provides a methodology 
<br>to connect peers with matching context. 
<br>
<br> Functions define a binary representation. 
<br>Two parallel strands of bits represent information
<br> and its bitwise relevance. 
<br>
<br> In the binary tree of permutations, 
<br>these are the path to a leaf
<br>and a complete subtree with the root node on it.

Principles of Distributed Contexting
@ul
- a double strand of bits
- a binary tree nodes and leaves
- an endless binary texture
