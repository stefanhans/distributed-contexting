### Reasons for understanding the digitalisation paradigm

- be a winner after digitalisation changed our lives |
- doing what you love with existential protection |
- being creative in a bigger construction of free teams |
- some participation on making the world a better place |

### ... but that's a bit too optimistic

Optimism is a duty. The future is open. It is not predetermined. No one can predict it, except by chance.
We all contribute to determining it by what we do. We are all equally responsible for its success.

Karl Popper
