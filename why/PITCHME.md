"Today, I believe weâ€™ve reached a critical 
<br> tipping point, and that powerful change 
<br>for the better is possibleâ€Šâ€”â€Šand necessary."

Note:

# For me, a tipping point is a crossroad with fundamental directions. And tipping points occur in inconsistent situations, situations with contradictions.

## For me, the main inconsistency in the domain of distributed systems is between distribution and concentration.

### The concentration of distributed systems

 or between paradigms and reality
- cloud, edge, and peer-to-peer computing |
- ai, data, and its economy of scale |
- blockchain, common good, and money |

Note:

Clouds are distributed systems concentrated in mostly three big companies - Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. 
Edge computing is mostly only a partial shift towards the edge of the network due to three reasons.
Latency, the massiveness of data, and that the effectiveness of CPU and storage is growing faster than the bandwidth.

## The big picture

- digitalisation between utopia and distropia |
- segregation of common good and money |
- mass extinction of nature and culture |

## We are on the way!

- cloud -> IPFS -> DAPPs |
- data silos -> decentralized data exchange |
- bitcoin -> blockchain-based computing |
- But, hold on... ðŸ¤” |

Imagine Microsoft would have invented <br> the World Wide Web technology ðŸ˜±

Do you think the new internet will end up <br> controlled by the big fives ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± <br> or disrupt them? ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ

At this crossroad, we are standing.

### Vision of a distributed system

- reactive, cost-free, and inherently operating |
- unlimited context domain |
- edge aware infrastructure |
- encrypted by design |
- protocol-based and language-agnostic |
- plugin architecture |
- suitable for blockchain and ai |

The Reactive Manifesto

## USP? Business case?

- no OPEX and no marginal costs |
- inherently no commercial interest <br> on the platform |
- application related services |
- bootstrap services and alike |
- data trading possibilities |
- additional services |

Note: 

Who needs that?


---


## Where do we stand?

- orchestration in the cloud -> in the internet |
- "interplanetary" in a few domains -> anywhere |
- being clients of very few -> being independent |
