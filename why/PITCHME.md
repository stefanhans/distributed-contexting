### The concentration of distributed systems

 or between paradigms and reality
- cloud, edge, and peer-to-peer computing |
- ai, data, and its economy of scale |
- blockchain, common good, and money |

Note:

The End of Cloud Computing - Peter Levine
latency, amount of data, costs of cpu and storage against bandwith

+++

## The big picture

- digitalisation between utopia and distropia |
- segregation of common good and money |
- mass extinction of nature and culture |

<br>be the biggest event in human history. 
<br>Unfortunately, it might also be the last."

## We are on the way!

- cloud -> IPFS -> DAPPs |
- data silos -> decentralized data exchange |
- bitcoin -> blockchain-based computing |

---

### Vision of a distributed system

- reactive, cost-free, and inherently created |
- unlimited context domain |
- edge aware infrastructure |
- encrypted by design |
- protocol-based and language-agnostic |
- plugin architecture |
- suitable for blockchain and ai |

The Reactive Manifesto

## Where do we stand?

- orchestration inside a cloud |
- "interplanetary" in a few domains |
- being clients of very few |

## What can we achieve?

- creating the digital world for us yourself |
- application orchestration in all networks |
- provide "interplanetary" for everything |

## USP? Business case?

- almost no OPEX and no marginal costs |
- inherently no commercial interest <br> on the platform |
- application creation related services |
- bootstrap services and alike |
- data trading possibilities |
- additional services |
