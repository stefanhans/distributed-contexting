Note:

What is distributed contexting? Distributed contexting is about distributed systems and contexting. Surprisingly, Contexting is hard to explain without its context which is actually distributed systems. I will start with distributed systems and come to contexting in a minute, so to speak.

There is one distributed system which is ubiquitous. The internet. I will start with a quote of a man who influenced it since nearly three decades and is still active.
