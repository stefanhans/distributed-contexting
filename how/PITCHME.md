### Structure and calculations

- Merkle Trees (IPFS, git, blockchain) |
- Artificial Neural Networks |
- Mathematical functions (hash, backpropagation) |

+++

### The ignored functions 

- Transformations (e.g. GPS) |
- Models (e.g. Taxonomies)|
- Descriptions (e.g. Text) |
- Functions can be combined |

### Distributed Contexting
- connect peers with matching context |
- functions define binary representations <br> - one strand of bits represents information <br> - one strand of bits represents relevance |
- in the binary tree of permutations <br> the peers build an overlay-network |
- the binary structure itself has no meaning, is endless, <br> and the peers navigate on it by simple rules |
<br> <br> <br>

Principles of Distributed Contexting
@ul
- a double strand of bits
- a binary tree nodes and leaves
- an endless binary texture
