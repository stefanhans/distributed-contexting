### Structure and calculations

- Merkle Trees (IPFS, git, blockchain) |
- Artificial Neural Networks |
- Mathematical functions (hash, backpropagation) |


### The ignored possibilities 

Functions can (be) more |
- Transformations (e.g. GPS) |
- Models (e.g. Taxonomies)|
- Descriptions (e.g. Text) |
- Functions can be combined |
