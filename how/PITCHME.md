### Structure and calculations

- Merkle Trees (IPFS, git, blockchain) |
- Artificial Neural Networks |
- Mathematical functions (hash, backpropagation) |

+++

### The ignored functions 

- Transformations (e.g. GPS) |
- Models (e.g. Taxonomies)|
- Descriptions (e.g. Text) |
- Functions can be combined |

Distributed Contexting provides a methodology 
<br>to connect peers with matching context. 
<br>
<br> Functions define a binary representation. 
<br>Two parallel strands of bits represent information
<br> and its bitwise relevance. 
<br>
<br> In the binary tree of permutations, 
<br>these are the path to a leaf
<br>and a complete subtree with the root node on it.
<br>

Principles of Distributed Contexting
@ul
- a double strand of bits
- a binary tree nodes and leaves
- an endless binary texture
